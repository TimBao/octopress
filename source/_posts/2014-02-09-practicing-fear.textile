	I must not fear.
	Fear is the mind-killer.
	Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
	I will face my fear.
	I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
	And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
	Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
	Only I will remain.
	                   Frank Herbert

Fear isn't necessarily a bad thing.  It's a defense mechanism.  But it can be paralyzing.

What makes fear good or bad is how we react to it.  Fear can make you stupid. It can make you forget to think. (is this part of the evolutionary response to fear?)
